In this project, we developed an advanced application aimed at enhancing the quality of real-time CCTV footage by effectively reducing or removing Gaussian noise. 
The core technology utilized in this project is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a state-of-the-art deep learning approach known for its ability to generate high-quality images. 

By training the GAN model on noisy and clean image pairs, the application learns to distinguish and eliminate noise,
thus restoring the clarity of the footage in real-time.
This project extensively utilizes Python and several of its powerful libraries, including PyTorch for implementing and training the GAN model, and Tkinter for building a user-friendly interface. 
The application is designed to be both efficient and scalable, making it suitable for various real-time surveillance scenarios where image quality is critical.

The result is a significant improvement in the clarity of CCTV images, enabling better analysis and monitoring in security systems.
